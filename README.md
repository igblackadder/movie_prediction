Film Genre Classification
=========================

Based on the synopsis of a movie, this project constructed a model to predict the film's genres. 
This is a problem of text analysis and multilabel learning. 
The result is a model with an outstanding average micro f1 score of 0.57 that can predict 40 unique genres.
I experimented with wrangling and vectorising the data in different ways and applying different learning algorithms.
The best model was an ensemble of naive bayes, support vector machines and random forests.
The analysis was done in a Jupyter notebook and is well documented. Feel free to shoot me any questions via gordonblackadder [at] gmail [dot] com
